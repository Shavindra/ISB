1. The European Space Agency (ESA) has asked you to design a probe that will look
for signs of life in another planet. What will your probe search for?

    > Chemical signatures
    > Molecular signatures
    > Bio Signautres
    > Environmental condtions
   
2. The function of a protein depends on it’s three dimensional structure, but
knowing how a protein folds in 3D is a complex problem. Do you see any way
trying to predict a protein function from its sequence?
> Homologs. 


5. Imagine you have a process, with a variable rate, that is making a product **A**. Another process is also consuming **A**. It’s very important to keep the concentration of **A** as stable as possible.
    **a)** If you have complete control over the production of **A**, how would you design a **controller** to keep **[A]** stable? What would you **measure**, and what would you **influence**?
    **b)** Could the mechanism you described be done **using only molecular interactions**? Explain briefly. 

## Summary notes
### Genome annotations
Genome annotationis the process of finding and designating locations of individual genes and other features on raw DNA sequences, calledassemblies.
Annotation gives meaning to a given sequence and makes it much easier for researchers to view and analyze its contents.

the rate (isotopomer flux analysis) of an enzyme-catalysed reaction depends on the 
- concentrations of the reactants (metabolomics)
- the concentration of the enzyme (proteomics), set by its mRNA concentration (transcriptomics), set by the gene activity, and set by mRNA and protein degradation rates
- the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, set by the gene sequence, 3D protein structure and organic chemistry of the catalysis the enzyme mechanism

A pivot (element) is the first nonzero entry in a row when the matrix is in (row) echelon form—i.e., scanning left→right within that row.
A row of all zeros has no pivot.

If a diagonal entry is 0 during elimination, you typically swap rows to bring a nonzero into that pivot position (partial pivoting).
